  abstract = {Highly distributed networks have now become a common
              infrastructure for a new kind of wide-area distributed
              applications whose key design principle is network awareness,
              namely the ability to deal with dynamic changes of the network
              environment. Network-aware computing has called for new
              programming languages that exploit the mobility paradigm as the
              basic interaction mechanism. In this paper we present the Klaim
              (Kernel Language for Agent Interaction and Mobility) framework for
              programming mobile code applications, namely the XKlaim
              programming language and the Java-based run-time system Klava. In
              particular, we illustrate how Klava handles mobile code. Finally,
              an example is shown that is implemented using this framework.},

@book{program_analysis,
	abstract = {{Program analysis concerns static techniques for computing reliable approximate information about the dynamic behaviour of programs. Applications include compilers (for code improvement), software validation (for detecting errors in algorithms or breaches of security) and transformations between data representation (for solving problems such as the Y2K problem). This book is unique in giving an overview of the four major approaches to program analysis: data flow analysis, constraint based analysis, abstract interpretation, and type and effect systems. The presentation demonstrates the extensive similarities between the approaches; this will aid the reader in choosing the right approach and in enhancing it with insights from the other approaches. The book covers basic semantic properties as well as more advanced algorithmic techniques. The book is aimed at M.Sc. and Ph.D. students but will be valuable also for experienced researchers and professionals.}},
