\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at Informatics Mathematical Modelling,
the Technical University of Denmark in partial fulfillment of the
requirements for acquiring the Ph.D.\ degree in engineering.

The thesis deals with different aspects of mathematical modeling of
systems using data and partial knowledge about the structure of the
systems.  The main focus is on extensions of non-parametric methods,
but also stochastic differential equations and neural networks are
considered.

The thesis consists of a summary report and a collection of ten
research papers written during the period 1996--1999, and elsewhere
published.
