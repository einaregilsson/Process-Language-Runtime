\chapter{Preface}
This report is my Master of Science Thesis. It was written between
January 15th 2009 and July 15th 2009, in the Language-Based Technology
Group of the Computer Science and Engineering section at the Informatics
and Mathematical Modeling department of the Technical University of
Denmark. My supervisor for this work was Associate Professor Christian
W. Probst.

I would like to thank the following people:

My supervisor Christian W. Probst who supported my initial
idea for the thesis, and was always available to answer
questions and provide support.
	
Henrik Pilegaard and Sebastian Nanz, whose course on Reactive systems
initially got me interested in process algebra.
	
Flemming and Hanne Riis Nielson and all the other members of the
Language-Based Technology group who helped me realize where
my interests lay within Computer Science
	
Most of all I thank my wife Karen, who moved with me to another country 
so that I could study at DTU and always supported me during my Masters 
studies. \textit{Thank you.}
